"""Evidence is checked before a ticket (the person's brief, 6 October 2026).

Before a fault ticket reaches Zoho Desk, Gemini looks at the customer's
photos and videos (a video is asked for first) and says whether they show the
problem. It passes only when the fault itself can be seen or heard and it is
the fault the customer described: a photo of the part alone is not enough.

The check runs at ingest, beside the photo safety check and the video summary
(api._inbound_attachments), and its verdict reaches the turn the way
`photos_unchecked` does. The runtime keeps it on the conversation and decides
everything from it in code: the support ticket tool refuses without a pass,
"talk to a person" in a fault chat records no ticket without one, and three
asks with nothing that passes end with EMotorad's customer care contact and no
ticket. A check that cannot be made never counts as a pass.

The client follows photo_check.py and video_summary.py: an injected
transport, a fixed prompt, strict JSON, and a stable code for every failure,
raised `from None` so no provider text reaches a log. Off unless
EMOTORAD_EVIDENCE_CHECK is `on` and the OpenRouter key is set.

A clip too big to send inline (most phone videos) is checked as a smaller
copy with its sound, made with the bundled ffmpeg inside the check's deadline
(fit_inline, round 2 of 6 October 2026). The copy lives only in the request:
the customer's original is what is stored and attached to Zoho.
